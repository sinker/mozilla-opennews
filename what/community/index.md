<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The developers, journalists, and data wranglers who make up the news code community work in newsrooms (and affiliated organizations) around the world, shipping interactive features, code libraries, and support systems at newsroom pace: fast. But much of the most innovative and useful work to emerge from the community requires time spent on documentation, cross-organizational collaboration, and peer teaching and learning—all of which require time away from the daily grind. Our programs act as community infrastructure, providing concrete editorial, financial, and organizational support for this work. </p>

### Source
Source is half community hub, half magazine—a place for working journalist-coders to share experiments, case studies, and documentation. It also includes Source Jobs, where news organizations can list development, data-handling, and design jobs for free. [Check it out and start contributing.](http://source.opennews.org/)

### Code Convenings

In 2014, we launched our first series of code convenings, small gatherings focused on completing and launching open-source projects. [Learn more.](convenings.html)

### Community Calls 

Every two weeks, we host an open conference call for the international news code community. The community calls include discussions of specific, recently launched projects and tools, announcements of new events, grants, jobs, etc., and updates from the Knight-Mozilla fellows in their newsrooms around the world. They're a perfect way to connect with new collaborators and learn more about the day-to-day work of newsroom developers. [Learn more and see when the next call is scheduled.](calls.html)

### Event Sponsorships

Since we launched OpenNews, we've sponsored 88 hack days and journalism-related code events from Armenia to Uruguay, and hosted several of our own in conjunction with the MIT-Knight Civic Media Conference. See our [event listings on Source](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/tags/events/) for a list of upcoming events, or [learn how to apply for sponsorship](/getinvolved/).
