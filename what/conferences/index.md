<p class="bodybig">The journalism-code community assembles at journalism and tech conferences around the world, and some of the most interesting parts of those events happen in the informal skillshares and hurried conversations between scheduled sessions. We host two annual events designed to provide space for those conversations and collaborations to bloom, surrounded by plentiful food, good coffee, and enthusiastic colleagues.</p>

We sold out SRCCON 2014 in three minutes, and it returns in the summer of 2015, with full details coming soon. [Learn more.](srccon.html)
