<p class="bodybig">In 2014, we hosted <a href="conferences/srccon.html">the inaugural SRCCON</a>, an event for people love to code in and near newsrooms. 175 developers, designers, journalists, civic hackers, and data nerds assembled at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia for two days of facilitated conversations and collaboration, plus an evening of skillshares, games, and plentiful time to catch up with peers.</p>

You can [check the schedule](http://schedule.srccon.org/) for session details and view [transcripts of many sessions](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-data/tree/master/2014/transcripts) thanks to our on-site captioning/transcription team. 

SRCCON will return in the summer of 2015, slightly bigger and lots better.  You can [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/opennews) or join the SRCCON announcements list to be notified as soon as we announce the location, dates, and session proposal details. (We sold out tickets in three minutes last year, so if you're interested, you'll want to get on the announcements list.)
