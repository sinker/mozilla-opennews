<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The <a href="http://2014.mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a> is a multi-day, annual celebration of the open internet for technologists, makers, educators, and creators in all fields. The OpenNews team organizes the Source Code for Journalism track of the festivalâ€”a whole floor of hands-on sessions on newsroom CMSes, technology choices, mapping and visualizations, and more.</p>

 The festival takes place in London each year, and dates for MozFest 2015 will be announced this spring. Sessions in the Source Code for Journalism track are chosen via open proposals, and session faciliators come from around the world to teach and learn with their peers.  Join us in discussions, hands-on making, and wireframing, and help explore new ways to visualize data, present information, and foster connections between people interested in harnessing the power of the web to create great journalism.
