<h3>Projects by the Knight-Mozilla Fellows</h3>
<p>Our <a href="/fellowships/community.html">Fellows</a> spend ten months hacking in some of the best newsrooms in the world, following their passions and creating compelling open-source projects. Here are just a few of the many things <a href="https://github.com/opennews">they've developed</a>:</p>
<ul class="fellowcode">
<li><a href="http://tabula.nerdpower.org/" class="fellowhack">Tabula</a>
<br>Tabula is a tool to extract tabular data from PDFs. The project was created by 2013 Knight-Mozilla Fellow Manuel Aristar√°n, with the help of 2013 Knight-Mozilla Fellow Mike Tigas and his colleague at ProPublica Jeremy B. Merrill.
<br>Key libraries :

</li>
<li><a href="http://hyperaud.io/" class="fellowhack">Hyperaudio</a>
<br>Mark Boas' Hyperaudio is a tool to facilitate the easy assemblage of audio and video programs from their underlying transcripts. The ongoing aims are to create something usable that works with both audio and video and allows transitions and overlaying to be specified via in-pad natural language instructions and to build up a library of material and to integrate with other third-parties such as Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles). Hyperaudio is currently a project with <a href="https://webfwd.org/portfolio">Mozilla's WebFWD</a>. In addition to Mark Boas, 2012 Knight-Mozilla Fellow Daniel Schultz and Matteo Spinelli are on the development team.

<li><a href="https://dataset.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" class="fellowhack">Dataset</a>
<br>Dataset is a tool from 2013 Knight-Mozilla Fellow Friedrich Lindenberg and Gregor Aisch to make it easier to manage databases in Python. Dataset makes it easier to import and export databases: "databases for lazy people."

<li><a href="https://github.com/veltman/learninglunches" class="fellowhack">Learning Lunches</a>
<br>2013 Knight-Mozilla Fellow Noah Veltman began organizing informal discussions with colleagues about technical topics. He's shared the materials from these discussions on GitHub. Topics have included databases, maps, and web scraping.
